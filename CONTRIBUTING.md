# Contributing Guide
First, thanks for contributing this project to make it better.
Before you start, we want to make sure you follow the guidelines
for contributing. Few words to describe the goal of this document:

* Avoid bureaucracy.
* Encourage contributions.
* Encourage contributors to remain involved.
* Make the contribution process as simple as possible.
* Make it clear how contributors can be involved the decision makings.

## Vocabulary
* A **contributor** is any individual participating an issue or pull request.
* A **committer** is one who has been given write access regarding the repository.

# Contributing
1. Be courteous and respectful. Every participant is expected to follow the project's Code of Conduct.
2. Any changes to resources in this repository **must** be through pull requests, this applies to all changes to codes, documentations, etc.
3. No pull request can be merged without being reviewed.
4. For non-trivial contributions, pull requests should sit for at least 36 hours to ensure that contributors in other timezones have time to review. Consideration should also be given to weekends and other holiday periods to ensure active committers all have reasonable time to become involved in the discussion and review process if they wish.
5. The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no committer has an objection.
6. In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another committer, all involved committers should seek to arrive at a consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed by discussion, compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change.
7. Anything should be written in English, for example, code comments, commit messages, pull requests as well as issues, etc.

# Becoming a Committer
All contributors who land a non-trivial contribution should be on-boarded in a timely manner, and added as a committer, and be given write access to the repository.

Committers are expected to follow this policy and continue to send pull requests, go through proper review, and have other committers merge their pull requests.
